	<h1>Maple Syrup</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>Maple syrup is a natural sweetener made from the sap of maple trees. 
	It has been enjoyed for centuries and is known for its rich flavor and versatility in cooking.
	This webpage explores its origins, production, and modern uses.</p>
	
	<h2>Origins and History</h2>
<p>Maple syrup production dates back to Indigenous peoples in North America,
	who discovered the sweet sap of maple trees and developed methods to collect and boil it into syrup.
	European settlers learned these techniques and commercialized the process in the 17th century.
	Today, Canada and the United States are the primary producers.</p>

	<h2>Production Process</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Tapping the Trees:</strong> In late winter or early spring, holes are drilled into maple trees to collect sap.</li>
    <li><strong>Collecting Sap:</strong> Sap flows into buckets or through tubing systems.</li>
    <li><strong>Boiling the Sap:</strong> The sap is boiled to evaporate water, concentrating the sugars into syrup. It takes about 40 gallons of sap to make 1 gallon of syrup.</li>
    <li><strong>Grading and Bottling:</strong> Syrup is graded by color and flavor (e.g., Golden, Amber, Dark) and bottled for sale.</li>
